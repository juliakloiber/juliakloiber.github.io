# Digital, aber gut

Uwe Heuser from the German newspaper Die Zeit is investigating why the most insightful critiques of digital technology as deployed by the tech companies come from women.

In his article he is featuring women at the forefront of this work in Germany and Europe: Francesca Bria, Carla Hustedt, Aline Blankertz and myself. You can read the whole article here (in German) [here].
